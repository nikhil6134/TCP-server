# TCP-server using C++
<hr>
its an application which is made using c++  and which echo back the client messages  
<br>

it is basically a tcp server created using c++ 
<br>
steps to make this server are:-
1.initialize winsock
<br>
2.create a socket
<br>
3.bind the socket to an ip address and port .//i used localhost
<br>
4.tell the winsock the socket is for listening 
<br>
5.close listening socket
<br>
6.while loop: accept and echo message back to client 
<br>
7.echo message back to the client
<br>
8.close the socket
<br>
9.shutdown the winsock
<br>
note: use putty software to send the client messages and use the same port as u done to create tcp server and also if any error coming like padding length so just go for raw instead of SSH 

THANK YOU!!
